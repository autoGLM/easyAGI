Objective: This script aims to implement an Autonomous General Intelligence (AGI) system that can perceive its environment, learn from data, make decisions, and communicate responses using various AI components.

Components:

    API Manager: Ensures that the necessary API keys are available and retrieves them.
    BDI Model: Manages the Belief-Desire-Intention model for AGI reasoning.
    Logic Tables: Used for logical reasoning and truth table generation.
    Socratic Reasoning: Provides reasoning capabilities based on Socratic methods.
    Reasoning System: General reasoning component.
    Self-Healing System: Ensures the system's robustness and self-repairing capabilities.
    Memory Management: Handles saving, loading, and deleting conversation memories.

Key Methods:

    __init__: Initializes all components and ensures API keys are set.
    perceive_environment: Gathers input data from the user or environment.
    learn_from_data: Processes and learns from the input data, updates the BDI model, generates logic tables, and reasons using Socratic and general methods.
    make_decisions: Uses the OpenAI GPT model to generate decisions based on learned knowledge.
    communicate_response: Outputs the decisions made by the AGI.
    main_loop: The main loop of the AGI, continuously running to perceive, learn, decide, and communicate, while also saving conversation memory.

Main Function:

    main: Instantiates the AGI and starts the main loop.

Detailed Breakdown

    Initialization (__init__ method):
        Initializes various AI components like APIManager, BDIModel, LogicTables, SocraticReasoning, Reasoning, and SelfHealingSystem.
        Ensures the OpenAI API key is available and sets it up.

    Environment Perception (perceive_environment method):
        Collects input from the user to define the problem or environment data.

    Learning from Data (learn_from_data method):
        Creates new beliefs and desires based on the input data.
        Updates the BDI model and forms intentions.
        Generates and displays a truth table for logical reasoning.
        Uses Socratic reasoning and general reasoning to draw conclusions from the data.

    Decision Making (make_decisions method):
        Constructs a prompt for the OpenAI GPT model to generate a decision based on the learned knowledge.
        Retrieves the response from the GPT model and extracts the decision.

    Response Communication (communicate_response method):
        Prints the solution or decision made by the AGI.

    Main Loop (main_loop method):
        Continuously runs the perception, learning, decision-making, and communication cycle.
        Saves the conversation memory when the loop ends.

Usage

    The script is designed to be run as a standalone application.
    It continuously interacts with the user, learning and making decisions based on the input provided.
